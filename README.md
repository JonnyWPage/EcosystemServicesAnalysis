# EcosystemServicesAnalysis
The natural world provides human society with a huge variety of services, many of which often go unnonticed until the habitat is no longer there.  These services, known as ecosystem services, can relate to direct economic value (such as the provision of raw materials), food security, clean water provision, human health (mental and physical), or protection against natural disasters, including flood protection or carbon sequestration.  To help make the value of intact ecosystems clear, some studies have attempted to estimate the monetary value of certain ecosystems through the scientific study of individual locations or wider areas.  This value is often estimated either through the economic value of services provided by these ecosystems (as is the case with food provision or raw materials), or through the estimated costs that would be incurred if the ecosystem were to disappear (for example the cost of flood defences).

The Ecosystem Services Partnership provides the Ecosystem Service Valuation Database (https://www.es-partnership.org/services/data-knowledge-sharing/ecosystem-service-valuation-database/).  This database estimates the monetary values of ecosystem services provided by over 300 case studies, and can be used as a good indication of how valuable individual ecosystems are across the globe.  In turn, data extracted from this database can be used to illustrate the value of natural spaces, particularly in cases where natural spaces are being threatened with destruction for human use, for example farming or housing.

This script tidies and standardizes the data from the ESVD TEEB database, and provides plots that illustrate the most valuable biomes, or ecosystem type, in terms of the monetary value of the ecosystem services they provide, as well as the most valuable services provided by these ecosystems worldwide.
